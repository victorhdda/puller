# Puller - a git pull script to update a blog server


### What is needed:

- Pull a git project from a static url periodically and update a blog content; :white_check_mark:
- Rename and move specific files to a new local folder; :white_check_mark:
- Add specific permissions to files (`-rwxr--r--`) and folders (`drwxr-xr-x`); :white_check_mark:
- Attach the execution of this script to a cron job. :white_check_mark:

### Solutions:
- It was created a script to process temporary and destination folders; clone remote public github repository; copy and rename contents do desired paths and change permissions.
- Also was created a cron job that executes this scripts periodically.


### Learned lessons

##### Find

The code above search for valid files from a specific name pattern and copy then to a new path.

```sh
find /tmp/aa02/ -type f -name '*.md' | xargs -I '{}' cp {} /tmp/aa02/folder
```

A safe way to delete files is to use the command `find` with the parameter `-delete`:

```sh
find /path/to/folder -delete
```

#### Rename

The command `rename` could be very useful associated to REGEX expressions. In the command above it is filtered preexistent date pattern in the filename.

```sh
rename -n 's/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})-//g' *
```

Execution:

```sh
user@pc:/tmp/folder$ rename -n 's/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})-//g' *
rename(2018-09-19-about.md, about.md)
rename(2018-09-19-ansible.md, ansible.md)
rename(2018-09-19-hexo-ferramentas-texto.md, hexo-ferramentas-texto.md)
rename(2018-09-23-vpn.md, vpn.md)
rename(2018-09-24-chmod.md, chmod.md)
rename(2018-09-24-kvm.md, kvm.md)
rename(2020-05-16-parallel.md, parallel.md)
```
The parameter `-n` shows what will be renamed, if removed, the command execute the change.


#### Cron

At the web server was configured a cron job to run the script periodically. The added line to `crontab -e` was:

```
* */1 * * * /path/to/script/folder/puller.sh /tmp/folder /dst/folder/; sudo docker restart id_of_the_container
```
Every hour the task runs automatically.


#### Docker

As the web server runs in a Docker container, it is necessary to restart that execution after those folders and files change.

The command `sudo docker restart id_of_the_container` at the cron job do that.

To identify the id of the running container is used the command

```sh
user@pc:~$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
id212132        davyyy/hexo         "/root/entrypoint.shâ€¦"   20 months ago       Up 43 minutes       0.0.0.0:4000->4000/tcp   hexo-server
```

With all this process the main objective was achieved and now is possible to link a web server to a git repository automatically. :smile:
